Description:
------------
This script implements an interactive, LLM-assisted version of the Short Blessed Test (SBT)
for cognitive impairment screening. It simulates an administrator administering the test
to a patient using a local language model (e.g., LLaMA via LangChain).

Features:
- Handles clarifying questions with redirection (zero penalty)
- Uses LLM for robust input parsing (e.g., months, names, numbers)
- Applies SBT scoring rules for each of the six questions
- Dynamically computes and reports final score with interpretation

Requirements:
- Python 3.9+
- LangChain
- Ollama or compatible local LLM backend

Usage:
------
Run the script from the terminal:
$ python main.py
